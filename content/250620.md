Everyone wyd<br>
Reflection time…<br>
From now on, I will throw away my trash properly…<br>

Half-asleep after waking up<br>
Just randomly got off the bus,,<br>
We're talking about Badge War<br>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ<br>
Seo Dahyun’s Badge War achievements<br>
1. Keyboard
2. Dog pants

That’s pretty solid though<br>

This one<br>
Even I don’t know <br>
what mindset I was in when I said that<br>
Hancom Typing Practice<br>
I haven’t heard of that in forever<br>
Back then<br>
If you mistyped even slightly<br>
the character would glare at you scarily<br>
So stressful,,,<br>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">So Dahja-nim did you use the OG Hancom Typing Practice?</span> < It was mandatory during elementary computer class<br>

Phew<br>
My nails grew again<br>
But still<br>
I think I’ve gotten used to typing now<br>
큐큐<br>
I make way fewer typos<br>
It’s really nice ㅋㅋ<br>
Yep now<br>

Didn’t expect it to go this fast<br>

I’ve got a scary story today<br>
Maybe it’s the rain or the humidity and darkness<br>
But I had sleep paralysis<br>
My body wouldn’t move<br>
But my mind was awake<br>
Awake?<br>
Please support tripleS Are You Alive💕💕💕<br>
Anyway<br>
I was like “Ah... please wake up”<br>
"Dahyun, snap out of it"<br>
I kept<br>
biting my tongue like crazy<br>
But still didn’t wake up<br>
So I just thought<br>
I’ll sleep this off<br>
I’ll beat the sleep paralysis<br>
But then I started hearing voices<br>
I heard Mayu unnie’s voice<br>
In a really high tone<br>
Saying "what what" to me<br>
I was like what the heck and suddenly woke up<br>
But no one was there…<br>
honestly terrifying<br>
I didn’t cry ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ<br>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">This is still a dream... you didn’t know ..? </span>< Wah….. I just realized….<br>
I think I experience weird stuff a lot<br>
One time I was asleep<br>
And during sleep paralysis<br>
A black figure<br>
Was climbing on top of me<br>
And the rain<br>
really made things creepier..///<br>
Right, when I was in the US<br>
Seoah and I<br>
had a nightmare at the same time<br>
It was so scary it gave me chills<br>
Let’s talk about something else now<br>

Lately I’ve been into old anime<br>
Stuff I watched as a school kid<br>
Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch<br>
[🔊]<br>
I also really love Yumeiro Patissiere<br>
[🔊]<br>
[🔊]<br>
Looking back at it now<br>
Old anime really<br>
Gave kids <br>
dreams and hope<br>
They had<br>
So many storiesㅜ<br>
about chasing your dreams, right<br>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Sometimes I think “wow this scene was in here” and it feels totally different since I’m older now</span> < Wow seriously!!<br>
Even scenes <br>
that seemed random<br>
Often had <br>
hidden foreshadowing<br>
or morals<br>
It’s so fascinating seeing that as an adult<br>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">The otaku is excited</span> < Honestly, my heart races. I, I can’t stop<br>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">When I talk about tripleS in front of friends, I forget to breathe.. </span>< ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ<br>
That’s actually<br>
Really nice though?????<br>
🥰🥰😘😘<br>
Dah-happy life<br>
Actually<br>
Watching the anime Full Moon wo Sagashite<br>
Made me think the singer job<br>
Was so….. cool<br>
Really looked up to it<br>
Pit-a-pat<br>
Whenever I watch the last episode of Full Moon <br>
I cry<br>
Anime is just<br>
Too precious…💕💕💕<br>
Hah seriously<br>
It’s overwhelming in the best way<br>
ㅠㅠ<br>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">To me Dahja-nim is like Dah-meiro Patissiere, Sugar Sugar Dah, Dah Moon, and Mermaid Melody Cherry Cherry Cherry</span> < So basically I’m every princess<br>
