<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Did you see the members’ Shugo Chara shorts today?</span> < I wanna do it too
ㅠㅠ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">I really liked Dahyun's puppy-shaped shorts from Badge War season 3... I looked it up, and I'm considering buying it now...</span> < A bunch of the members want them now too
Those shorts
are right next to me rn
ㅎㅎ
The day will come
when I’ll wear them again
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Please do a live in those shorts</span> < You’re just gonna look at the shorts, not me
No way
Now I’m jealous
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Dahyun-ah.... I think I found those shorts on Coupang</span> < ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅠㅠ
WAV
If we all wore that to the concert
Wouldn’t it be so fun, hah

No but
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
How could it be called a useless gift ㅠㅠ
Seriously
they’re super useful
So comfy
to sleep in
ㅠㅠ
It kinda feels like
the dog on the shorts
is protecting me
while I sleep
ㅎㅎ
My. My guardian spirit
The name will be
Keongkeongi [barking sound]
Those crazy eyes
fits Keong-keong 
More than meong-meong or war-war
\#ThankYouKeongkeong
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">The poor puppy always gets squished by Dahyun.. </span>< But Keongkeongi still protects me.
Wah
You're saying that scene in Badge War 3 Episode 3,
is the most replayed one?
ヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲヲ
A seriously please ㅠㅠ
There is no way
Please
They should really change the name
to Super Useful Gift
Thank you so much Keongkeongi
You really are my guardian spirit
No like seriously
I assumed
since it was a wake-up mission
I’d be sitting on the floor 
like in Season 2
so I thought
“No one will see this”
ㅎㅎ
But it was so visible
Dah-embarrassed^-^;;
Shoutout to Keongkeongi’s screen presence
I really love funny dogs

💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Dahyun-time🦍🦧🦧🦧💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Ah I’m happy
Thank you everyone for celebrating my birthday.
Ah
One minute
Why did it
pass by so fast
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Who are you</span> < ㅠㅠ

My old
wallpaper
![[Pasted image 20250701210402.png | 200]]
was this
Kinda looks like
me when I cry
Hah………
I’ve been told I look like a chihuahua
![[Pasted image 20250701210455.png | 200]]
had tons of pictures like this
You know how chihuahuas
get super snappy when you bother them
That’s so funny to me
Maybe even more than maltese
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Dah-huahua
^\_^~~~

Ah I turned on the aircon
But now it’s too cold
Turning it off immediately
I hate hate the rainy season
It’s shocking
that It’s almost
July
huh
I can tolerate
all the humidity
but I will not tolerate
my Dahja hair wave
going flat
ㅡㅡ
Hairstylist-ssaem: All right, all done ㅎㅎ
"Thank you!!"
After leaving the salon:
Hair becomes straight again
So sad
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Hot & completely dry vs cold & super humid</span> < totally the first one
If it’s dry, I can at least protect my hair💕💕💕💕💕💕
I have to show WAVs my waves
Maybe it’s time to trim a little
It grew again already

Today at the vocal room
I had a 1:1 lesson with Soomin
And our Soomin
has improved so much
I’m happy and proud
She’s full of passion
So
I want to teach her even more ㅠ
Of course I’m still lacking a lot too……..

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Suppose you’re at a noraebang and someone’s singing next door and you think it’s a WAV but they’re bad at singing, would you go in and give a lesson? </span>< No ㅎㅎ
I’d just go in and say
"Wanna do a duet"
We’ll put on Door 
disco version
And WAV will hit the 3tier high notes
I have to witness that ㅎㅎ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Will you let them do the "dasi haebolkka" arrow part vs you doing it</span> < Wah………..
Should we each sing one character? ㅠㅠ
Ah, it’s an odd number
One of us has to sing three characters
WAV, I’ll let you have it
Wav : Da    Hae      Kka
Dah :      Si        Bol
Ah
That’s
a little
O h..
Just sing the whole thing WAV ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜ

Current Seo Dahyun mood
Don’t You Cry It’s All A Nightmare [Are You Alive]
Don't cry < this part
We kinda
did good
for WAV
ㅎㅎ
Wah
I’m currently listening
to the guide I did for Girls Never Die
*Hold me closer broken myself*
My part
was actually really
Quiet and dreamy
[🔊] (*Hold me closer broken myself*)
Vibe hits different
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's smooth.
But in the final version it’s like
I AM SEO DA HYUN;;;;;;;
is what the vibe is
Right
In the guide I was like
*Na jaba…jwo…*
Now it’s
Naljabawav
<span style="color:rgb(110, 110, 110)">[🔊] </span>
The adlib
had slightly different notes too
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Overall it felt like mist somehow</span> < Oh kinda like that
*Angaecheoreom sarajyeo make move* [disappear like fog make move]

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Soda what was your first phone??</span>  < Mine was
The kind
where the side button made it flip open
What was it called again
Anyphone?
Ah
Anycall
I always
played Minigame Party on that
Got it from my parents 
in 2nd grade
ㅎㅎ
My next phone was
the Galaxy S2
ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
My phone was Jeong Hyerin
And after that
I think
my Dah-dad proudly got me
The top-tier phone of the time
Galaxy Note 3
ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
But I was addicted
to Princess Maker
and Bounce Ball
So it kept getting confiscated
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">The national meta back then—Bounce Ball and Geometry Dash</span> < ㅠㅠ Hah
Honestly
I still play Geometry Dash
ㅠㅜ
No but the music is too good
My favorite map is
Jumper < this one
I loved the bgm so much
that I printed the sheet music
and played it on piano
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Insane
Then my next phone was
The Galaxy S7 Edge
The “Edge” part
looked so pretty
Yup I really used Galaxy
for a long time huh
^ㅅ^;;
Then came
That one
the iPhone 7
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Nowㅜ crossed over
to iPhone
Honestly Galaxy is easier to use
but the camera 
on iPhone
is soooo my style
so I switched
That sentimental vibe, you know
ㅋㅋ

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Did you ever break a phone? Not recently, but back then ㅋㅋ</span> < Ah
When I used the Galaxy S2
I threw it in the washing machine by accident
Heard a strange sound and went
"Ah please"
and it was my phone for real
So you know
at the back of the phone
the phone batteries?
back then, they weren't built in
but was removable, right
That one
it puffed up like crazy
Total disaster
ㅎㅎ………
That day, got spanked by SoMom
ㅠㅠ

Oh wait
WAV
I really
That
My first flip phone
That Anycall
It’s still at our old house you know??
It has all my childhood photos and stuff
But I’m so upset
because it won’t charge
So I want to fix it
but it’s such an old phone….
Would the service center even fix
something that old…?
It’s been like 15 years
Might not have parts………….
Charger works
but the port is broken
It needs repairㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Let’s try just extracting the data to your current phone</span> < Can that be done???????
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Is the battery removable too?</span> < Probably ㅠㅠ
I really want to save it
so I can show WAVs
my childhood pics…..
Heuaaaaaaaa
When I get a vacation and go to Busan
I’ll do everything I can
Please. Please come back to life

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Even if you can’t fix the phone ask if they can extract the memory</span> < Me-memory, what's that\~\~~….💕💕💕💕💕
Ah
I have a good idea!!
I'll ask my mom's son back home
right now
ㅎㅎ
I’ll try calling my sibling
Just called but
My call
got rejected
Ha…………
He's probably shocked
Like "Huh???? Why she calling me;;;;;;;"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
They texted back
"o?"
That’s all………..
Forget it I’ll just sleep………….
I texted:
"do you remember my anycall phone??"
And they said:
"nope bye"
Wah I’m actually so annoyed
I'm just not gonna reply
Like why add the bye
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I think
He’s pretending not to know.
There’s no way he forgot.
I’ll just go to Busan
and revive it myself
