Hehe

Hi

Dahja flying free through the sky~~~~

Everyone wyd



Reflection time…

From now on, I will throw away my trash properly…

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ,,,

Half-asleep after waking up
Just randomly got off the bus,,
We're talking about Badge War
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Seo Dahyun’s Badge War achievements
1. Keyboard
2. Dog pants

That’s pretty solid though
Eomma uyu sawa<span style="color:rgb(110, 110, 110)"> [Mom get some milk]</span>
This one
Even I don’t know 
what mindset I was in when I said that
Hancom Typing Practice
I haven’t heard of that in forever
Back then
If you mistyped even slightly
the character would glare at you scarily
So stressful,,,
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">So Dahja-nim did you use the OG Hancom Typing Practice?</span> < It was mandatory during elementary computer class
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Phew
My nails grew again
But still
I think I’ve gotten used to typing now
큐큐
I make way fewer typos
It’s really nice ㅋㅋ
Yep now
My original speed
Returns
Fufu
The power of two-finger <span style="color:rgb(110, 110, 110)">[doksuri] </span>typing
Dah-suri typing
My talent
Drying my hair in 1 minute
Did it super fast
How is it
How is it how is it
How’s Seo Dahja~~

How to flirt with Sodahyun?
One wink from WAV is enough
WAV's wink
In short
Wavk
Isn’t that cute?


My hair color’s faded a lot
Now it’s got a brown vibe
Heuk I’m sad
I knew it would fade but
Didn’t expect it to go this fast
Still using color shampoo 
regularly
I like black hair too
But people say it makes me look too fierce
Heuk heuk
When I first
became an adult
I tried bleaching it just once
But I haven’t done it since
It was so 
damaging
Hair would break
But now
it’s the start of rainy season?
Why
is it
raining
Noo..
I hate it
My hair gets frizzy fast
I need to show WAV 
my perfect Dahja hair though
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">The power of Dahja: Hair</span> < Agreed
ㅎㅎ

Rainy seasonㅠㅠ I hate itttt
And after the rain
Will it be
Mosquito bomb season?…
The vueeeng sound
hate it so much
If I see one, I’ll just
<span style="color:rgb(110, 110, 110)">[🔊]  (smacking sound) </span>
Do that
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">What if WAV turns into a mosquito</span> < I’ll make a mini bed, tuck you in with a tiny handkerchief blanket
ㅎㅎ
Mo…mosquito best💕💕💕
Mo…mosquito I love
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">If Soda turned into a mosquito, I’d give you all my blood</span> < And then if I go near the bug zapper
zap… zap…
I’d cry

I’ve got a scary story today
Maybe it’s the rain or the humidity and darkness
But I had sleep paralysis
My body wouldn’t move
But my mind was awake
Awake?
Please support tripleS Are You Alive💕💕💕
Anyway
I was like “Ah... please wake up”
"Dahyun, snap out of it"
I kept
biting my tongue like crazy
But still didn’t wake up
So I just thought
I’ll sleep this off
I’ll beat the sleep paralysis
But then I started hearing voices

I heard Mayu unnie’s voice
In a really high tone
Saying "what what" to me
I was like what the heck and suddenly woke up
But no one was there…
honestly terrifying
I didn’t cry ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">This is still a dream... you didn’t know ..? </span>< Wah….. I just realized….
I think I experience weird stuff a lot
One time I was asleep
And during sleep paralysis
A black figure
Was climbing on top of me
And the rain
really made things creepier..///
Right, when I was in the US
Seoah and I
had a nightmare at the same time
It was so scary it gave me chills
Let’s talk about something else now

Lately I’ve been into old anime
Stuff I watched as a school kid
Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch
[🔊]
I also really love Yumeiro Patissiere
[🔊]
[🔊]
Looking back at it now
Old anime really
Gave kids 
dreams and hope
They had
So many storiesㅜ
about chasing your dreams, right
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Sometimes I think “wow this scene was in here” and it feels totally different since I’m older now</span> < Wow seriously!!
Even scenes 
that seemed random
Often had 
hidden foreshadowing
or morals
It’s so fascinating seeing that as an adult
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">The otaku is excited</span> < Honestly, my heart races. I, I can’t stop
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">When I talk about tripleS in front of friends, I forget to breathe.. </span>< ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That’s actually
Really nice though?????
🥰🥰😘😘
Dah-happy life
Actually
Watching the anime Full Moon wo Sagashite
Made me think the singer job
Was so….. cool
Really looked up to it
Pit-a-pat
Whenever I watch the last episode of Full Moon 
I cry
Anime is just
Too precious…💕💕💕
Hah seriously
It’s overwhelming in the best way
ㅠㅠ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">To me Dahja-nim is like Dah-meiro Patissiere, Sugar Sugar Dah, Dah Moon, and Mermaid Melody Cherry Cherry Cherry</span> < So basically I’m every princess
Hihi
Dah-princess feeling good
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Have you watched Haikyuu??!!</span> < Curious but haven’t yet
I heard it’s super emotional too
(getting interested)
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">You not into stuff like Attack on Titan??</span> < I can’t with the people-eating parts
ㅠㅠ
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Which Pokémon season did you like?????????????</span> < Oh I’m absolutely
Gen 4
The Dialga, Palkia, Arceus generation
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">I like sylveon</span> < Me espeon and glaceon
They look elegant
But my true fave is pachirisu
Couldn’t live without it in elementary school
Chi-pachi-pa
But it’s kinda weak:;
Still
As long as it’s cute
💕💕💕💕🦍

Ah suddenly
I miss Kaede
Last night
Kaede suddenly walked into my room
And just casually laid down on my bed
Sometimes she
Falls asleep in my room
